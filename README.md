# Sad.X
Sad.X is an alternative monetization strategy for video games. Instead of hosting adds, requiring payments, or freemium, gamers pay with their extra processing power while they play the game.

Our approach to this was to break the NP-Hard problem 3-SAT into chunks and distribute those chunks to the players. When the CPU usage goes too high, the computation overhead decreases to avoid affecting gameplay.
